Useing the addon:
*****************


Acronyms are used frequently on IRC to say something quickly.
Oz Acronyms will enable you to extend the acronym into its   
complete text meaning ie: lol will convert to Laughing out Loud.
How to add acronyms: 
Input: Is where you add your shortened term ie: brb
Output: Is where you add your complete term ie: Be Right Back
Wav midi mp3: Is where you add a sound file ie: brb.wav 
Now every time you type brb in your text to send, it will 
convert to Be Right Back and will be accompanied with a
sound of your choice. Leaving the Wav midi mp3 blank, will still 
allow the text conversion to work without sound. 

Sounds: To add a new sound file, firstly you must copy or drag
the file name into the Acronyms folder within mIRC.

My Acronyms arn't working on one channel: This is likely to 
happen when the channel is set to +c , To still use acronyms 
on the channel add the #channel name to section above this
help section and your acronym will be stripped of colour and 
will send to the channel.
